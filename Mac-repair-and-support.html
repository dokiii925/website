    <h1> No Apple Store Lines, No Headaches. </h1>
    <p> We all know the feeling , you walk into an Apple Store, wait in line, and somehow walk 
out more confused (and broke) than when you went in. You don’t need that. You just 
need your Mac fixed, properly and honestly. 
That’s what I do. Quick turnarounds, clear communication, and straightforward repairs 
that keep your Mac running like new. You’ll always know what’s happening, and you’ll 
never pay for things you don’t need.</p>
