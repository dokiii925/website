    <h1> Tired of Wrestling with Your Own Website? </h1>
    <p> You try to update your site, and suddenly something breaks. Or the contact form stops 
working. Or the images don’t fit anymore. You didn’t sign up to be a web developer , you 
just want a site that stays clean and current. 
That’s what I do: handle the design, maintenance, and small fixes that keep your site 
running smoothly.  </p>

    <p> You get to focus on your business while I keep things beautiful and 
functional behind the scenes. </p>
